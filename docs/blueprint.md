## Core Features:

- Medical Record Generation: Generate synthetic medical records for neurological and mental health conditions using a pre-trained GAN. Allows users to specify disease type and number of records.
- Medical Report Enrichment: Enrich synthetic records with realistic textual descriptions (doctor's notes, therapy recommendations) generated using the GPT-5 tool.
- Data Visualization and Export: Display generated records in a tabular format with features like sorting and filtering, and export them in CSV.
- Data Insights Dashboard: Present data insights through charts displaying symptom frequency, age distribution and disease breakdown.
- Disease Selection: Allow users to select from a dropdown menu the desired disease type (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Epilepsy, Stroke, Brain Tumor, Multiple Sclerosis, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, Cognitive Decline).
- Record Count Selection: Define the count of records to be generated using a numeric input.
- Responsive Dashboard UI: Implement a clean and responsive dashboard for real-time data generation and demo.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) to evoke a sense of trust and calm, aligned with healthcare themes.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), nearly white, creating a clean and professional feel.
- Accent color: Darker blue (#4682B4) to highlight key actions and interactive elements, providing contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern and neutral look suitable for both.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent different data categories and actions. Adhere to a consistent style for all icons.
- Implement a clean, grid-based layout for the dashboard to ensure information is well-organized and easy to find. Use clear visual hierarchy.
- Use subtle animations (e.g., loading spinners) to enhance user experience without being distracting.
